This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Open [zacklow28covidstatistics](https://zacklow28covidstatistics.netlify.app/) to view it in your browser.

This app is used to display Covid-19 statistics for different countries. You can select a country and a date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) to view the data for that country on that date. It also contains simple charts for quick visualization of the data.
